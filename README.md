# ðŸ”§ Python Progress Tracker: Strings & Data Manipulation

Welcome to your Python mastery journey focused on **strings** and **data structures** â€” the foundation for most real-world programming and interviews.

This roadmap is broken into five progressive stages, each introducing core concepts, then building upon them with challenges.

---

## âœ… Progress Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 1: Basic Looping & Access
- [ ] Loop through lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- [ ] Understand `enumerate`, `.items()`, `.keys()`, `.values()`
- [ ] Access elements safely (e.g., index bounds, missing keys)

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 2: Add/Remove Elements
- [ ] Append/insert/remove in lists
- [ ] Add/update/delete in dictionaries
- [ ] Understand immutability of tuples

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 3: Nested Structures
- [ ] List in dictionary: `{"a": [1, 2]}`
- [ ] Dictionary in list: `[{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}]`
- [ ] Nested dictionaries: `{"a": {"b": 2}}`
- [ ] Access and modify nested data safely

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 4: String Manipulation
- [ ] Iterate over characters in strings
- [ ] Use `split()`, `join()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, etc.
- [ ] Convert between strings and lists/dictionaries

### ðŸ”¹ Stage 5: Mini Challenges
- [ ] Real-world simulations and combined structure problems
- [ ] Increasing difficulty, minimal hints
- [ ] Optional themes (inventory manager, email parser, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Guiding Principles
- Practice before peeking
- Progress > perfection
- Break problems into parts
- Focus on **understanding**, not memorizing
