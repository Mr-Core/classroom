Exercise 1: Grouping and Summarizing

You're given a list of transactions. Each transaction is a dictionary with "user", "amount", and "type".

transactions = [
    {"user": "Alice", "amount": 50, "type": "deposit"},
    {"user": "Bob", "amount": 20, "type": "withdrawal"},
    {"user": "Alice", "amount": 30, "type": "withdrawal"},
    {"user": "Daisy", "amount": 100, "type": "deposit"},
    {"user": "Bob", "amount": 70, "type": "deposit"},
    {"user": "Daisy", "amount": 20, "type": "withdrawal"},
]


Task 1:
Create a dictionary that stores the total deposited amount for each user.

Output should look like:
{"Alice": 50, "Daisy": 100, "Bob": 70}


Task 2:
Create a dictionary that shows the net balance (deposit - withdrawal) per user.

Output should look like:
{"Alice": 20, "Bob": 50, "Daisy": 80}


Task 3:
List all users who made more than one transaction, regardless of type.

Output should be:
["Alice", "Bob", "Daisy"]

Note: This one's sneaky â€” you'll want a dictionary or collections.Counter!


Bonus Task:
Print a summary like:

Alice: 2 transactions, net balance 20
Bob: 2 transactions, net balance 50
Daisy: 2 transactions, net balance 80
